            <h3>What you need to know about PayPal</h3>
            <p>PayPal’s reputation as a trusted payment platform has taken a hit due to a series of recent issues that leave users questioning its reliability. Cases of unauthorized transactions, delayed refunds, and failed buyer protections are becoming increasingly common. For instance, a customer discovered multiple unauthorized charges on their account, only to face a prolonged investigation that offered little reassurance. In another case, a seller lost both their product and money when a fraudulent buyer exploited PayPal’s policies to file a false claim. Even those who rely on PayPal for extended warranties have faced challenges, as some warranties turned out to be invalid, with PayPal refusing to intervene. Delayed fund transfers add to the frustration, as users wait weeks to access their own money without clear explanations. These recurring problems highlight gaps in PayPal’s protection plans, leaving both buyers and sellers vulnerable.</p>
